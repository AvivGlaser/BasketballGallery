# Basketball Teams Showcase

This is a small project designed to showcase basketball teams using **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **MongoDB**, and **Next.js**. The purpose of this project is to explore and experiment with the latest additions and best practices in React development.

## Purpose

The project serves as a playground for:
- Trying out the newest features in React, such as the **useQuery** hook and **AbortController**.
- Implementing modern practices and patterns in React applications.
- Working with a backend using **MongoDB** to fetch and display data.
- Exploring how **Next.js** can be used for server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes.

## Tech Stack
- **React 19**: The latest version of React to try new features and optimize development.
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety and enhancing code quality.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store and manage basketball teams data.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
